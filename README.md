# KNIME

This presentation introduces KNIME, an open-source data analytics and machine learning tool. I explore its user-friendly visual interface, showcasing its capabilities in integrating data sources, preprocessing, applying machine learning algorithms, and visualizing results. Through practical examples, I demonstrate KNIME's versatility in data analysis and predictive modeling. The associated repository provides code examples, workflows, and documentation to support users in utilizing KNIME effectively.
